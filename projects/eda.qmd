# Strikeouts Over Time: Plotting Pitcher Trends

Baseball has a stat for everything, from the well known "batting average" to more obscure statistics such as "OPS", "fWAR", and "ERA+". When all these different statistics are thrown together in a table, it can be hard to understand what exactly the jumble of numbers mean. In this tutorial, I will go through the process of turning raw data from a .csv file into interpretable charts where relationships between parameters of interest can be analyzed. 

By the end, you’ll be able to:

- Load a CSV of pitcher stats into pandas  
- Filter the data to a single pitcher  
- Summarize strikeouts by year  
- Plot a simple, readable line chart in matplotlib

I will go through this process using recently retired Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw, but you can pick any pitcher you'd like for this tutorial!

## 1. Getting MLB pitcher data into pandas

The MLB makes a lot of their data avaliable through online tools like [MLB Baseball Savant (Statcast search)](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search). For this tutorial I would recommend using this same site, although there are others, such as BaseballReference.com and Sportsradar.com. To start out this project, we will:

1. Use a web interface (like Statcast search or another MLB stats page).  
2. Filter for pitchers, under "included stats" check strikeouts and export the results as a CSV file.  
3. Save it as something like `pitcher_stats.csv` in the same folder as your notebook/script.

The CSV should include these three columns: 

- `player_name` – pitcher’s name  
- `season` – year of the season (e.g., 2019, 2020, …)  
- `so` – strikeouts


```python
import pandas as pd

# Read in your downloaded MLB pitcher stats
df = pd.read_csv("pitcher_stats.csv")

# Take a quick look at the columns and first few rows
print(df.columns)
df.head()
```

You'll want to pick your pitcher and filter the dataset to only include that pitcher. Here you'll also want to sort the values by season.

```python
#Pick your pitcher
pitcher_name = "Kershaw, Clayton"

#Filter the dataset
pitcher_df = df.query("player_name == @pitcher_name").copy()

# Make sure season is sorted numerically
pitcher_df["year"] = pitcher_df["year"].astype(int)
pitcher_df = pitcher_df.sort_values("year")
