I enjoy living in a state where the outdoors is always just a few minutes away, whether its skiing, hiking, or fishing, I love it all. I have a wide range of interests in the field of data science, mainly related to personal experiences and hobbies. I am Hispanic as well as a first-generation American and student. This combined with pre-medical coursework in high school contributes to my interest in immigrant healthcare statistics. I also grew up watching baseball as a family activity, so sports analytics is something that I am passionate about."

    "text": "4. Interpreting the plot\nNow that we can see Clayton Kershaw’s strikeouts per year visually, it is easy to see that he was fairly consistent from the 2021-2023 seasons. In 2024, his number of strikeouts plummeted before recovering partly in 2025. My first question after seeing this graph is, what happened in 2024? A quick Google search reveals that he started the 2024 season on the injured list, started partway through the season, then ended early due to a new injury.\nDepending on which pitcher you have chosen, you might have different things stick out to you. For example:\n\nIs there a season where the strikeout count jumps up or falls sharply?\nIs your pitcher consistent or did they just have one breakout season?\nIs your pitcher trending up or down over time?\n\nAfter seeing the trends in your data, you can explore even further. Another statistic that is frequently used is K/9, which refers to the number of strikeouts per 9 innings. \\[\nK/9 = 9 \\times \\frac{\\text{strikeouts}}{\\text{innings pitched}}\n\\] This can be more accurate to a pitchers actual ability as it can account for time spent injured or not playing as a starter. By modifying the code above, it can be a simple change to create a new column with values obtained by dividing the strikeouts by the innings pitched, then multiplying by 9.",
