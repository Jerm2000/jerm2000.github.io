    "text": "Background\nHello! I am a senior at Brigham Young University in Utah, but am originally from Montana. I enjoy living in a state where the outdoors is always just a few minutes away, whether its skiing, hiking, or fishing, I love it all. I have a wide range of interests in the field of data science, mainly related to personal experiences and hobbies. I am Hispanic as well as a first-generation American and student. This combined with pre-medical coursework in high school contributes to my interest in immigrant healthcare statistics. I also grew up watching baseball as a family activity, so sports analytics is something that I am passionate about."

Part of my duties entailed communicating with Spanish speaking patients and recording information relevant to their conditions. I feel that this unique connection to and understanding of the healthcare field, specifically regarding the immigrant population, allows me to more effectively analyze immigrant healthcare statistics."

This is something that will come with practice and that I hope to highlight through my posts on this site. In the long term, I hope to be working in one of my areas of interest, either working for the government performing data analysis and inference based on immigrant healthcare data to better serve that population, or working with the MLB to identify variables of interest based on current season data."

    "text": "Baseball has a stat for everything, from the well known “batting average” to more obscure statistics such as “OPS”, “fWAR”, and “ERA+”. When all these different statistics are thrown together in a table, it can be hard to understand what exactly the jumble of numbers mean. In this tutorial, I will go through the process of turning raw data from a .csv file into interpretable charts where relationships between parameters of interest can be analyzed.\nBy the end, you’ll be able to:\n\nLoad a CSV of pitcher stats into pandas\n\nFilter the data to a single pitcher\n\nSummarize strikeouts by year\n\nPlot a simple, readable line chart in matplotlib\n\nI will go through this process using recently retired Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw, but you can pick any pitcher you’d like for this tutorial!\n\n\n\nThe MLB makes a lot of their data avaliable through online tools like MLB Baseball Savant (Statcast search). For this tutorial I would recommend using this same site, although there are others, such as BaseballReference.com and Sportsradar.com. To start out this project, we will:\n\nUse a web interface (like Statcast search or another MLB stats page).\n\nFilter for pitchers, under “included stats” check strikeouts and export the results as a CSV file.\n\nSave it as something like pitcher_stats.csv in the same folder as your notebook/script.\n\nThe CSV will have many columns, but should at least include these three columns:\n\nplayer_name – pitcher’s name\n\nyear – year of the season (e.g., 2019, 2020, …)\n\nso – strikeouts\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in your downloaded MLB pitcher stats\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"pitcher_stats.csv\")\n\n# Take a quick look at the columns and first few rows\nprint(df.columns)\ndf.head()\nYou’ll want to pick your pitcher and filter the dataset to only include that pitcher. Here you’ll also want to sort the values by season.\n#Pick your pitcher\npitcher_name = \"Kershaw, Clayton\"\n\n#Filter the dataset\npitcher_df = df.query(\"player_name == @pitcher_name\").copy()\n\n# Make sure season is sorted numerically\npitcher_df[\"year\"] = pitcher_df[\"year\"].astype(int)\npitcher_df = pitcher_df.sort_values(\"year\")",

I will be updating this page regularly as I continue to refine my data science related skills, so maek sure to check in regularly to see what I’m working on. Check out the about me page to get to know me and see more of my background.\n\n\nThis portfolio shows my work learning data science.
