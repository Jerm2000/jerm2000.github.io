    "text": "Background\nHello! I am a senior at Brigham Young University in Utah, but am originally from Montana. I enjoy living in a state where the outdoors is always just a few minutes away, whether its skiing, hiking, or fishing, I love it all. I have a wide range of interests in the field of data science, mainly related to personal experiences and hobbies. I am Hispanic as well as a first-generation American and student. This combined with pre-medical coursework in high school contributes to my interest in immigrant healthcare statistics. I also grew up watching baseball as a family activity, so sports analytics is something that I am passionate about."

    "text": "Baseball has a stat for everything, from the well known “batting average” to more obscure statistics such as “OPS”, “fWAR”, and “ERA+”. When all these different statistics are thrown together in a table, it can be hard to understand what exactly the jumble of numbers mean. In this tutorial, I will go through the process of turning raw data from a .csv file into interpretable charts where relationships between parameters of interest can be analyzed.\nBy the end, you’ll be able to:\n\nLoad a CSV of pitcher stats into pandas\n\nFilter the data to a single pitcher\n\nSummarize strikeouts by year\n\nPlot a simple, readable line chart in matplotlib\n\nI will go through this process using recently retired Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw, but you can pick any pitcher you’d like for this tutorial!\n\n\n\nThe MLB makes a lot of their data avaliable through online tools like MLB Baseball Savant (Statcast search). For this tutorial I would recommend using this same site, although there are others, such as BaseballReference.com and Sportsradar.com. To start out this project, we will:\n\nUse a web interface (like Statcast search or another MLB stats page).\n\nFilter for pitchers, under “included stats” check strikeouts and export the results as a CSV file.\n\nSave it as something like pitcher_stats.csv in the same folder as your notebook/script.\n\nThe CSV will have many columns, but should at least include these three columns:\n\nplayer_name – pitcher’s name\n\nyear – year of the season (e.g., 2019, 2020, …)\n\nso – strikeouts\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in your downloaded MLB pitcher stats\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"../pitcher_stats.csv\")\n\n# Take a quick look at the columns and first few rows\n#print(df.columns) (Uncomment this line to check the column names!)\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npitches\nplayer_id\nplayer_name\nyear\ntotal_pitches\npitch_percent\nba\niso\nbabip\nslg\n...\nxslgdiff\nwobadiff\nswing_miss_percent\narm_angle\nattack_angle\nattack_direction\nswing_path_tilt\nrate_ideal_attack_angle\nintercept_ball_minus_batter_pos_x_inches\nintercept_ball_minus_batter_pos_y_inches\n\n\n\n\n0\n3282\n657277\nWebb, Logan\n2025\n3282\n100.0\n0.264\n0.122\n0.349\n0.386\n...\n0.010\n0.009\n24.7\n22.1\n6.707878\n4.001445\n33.708467\n0.447011\n37.166778\n27.691825\n\n\n1\n3281\n543037\nCole, Gerrit\n2023\n3286\n99.8\n0.206\n0.116\n0.263\n0.322\n...\n-0.056\n-0.033\n26.2\n42.1\n8.474908\n0.982880\n30.455157\n0.509887\n38.013593\n28.368005\n\n\n2\n3274\n669203\nBurnes, Corbin\n2022\n3274\n100.0\n0.197\n0.144\n0.259\n0.341\n...\n0.005\n-0.006\n35.2\n41.3\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n3\n3274\n543037\nCole, Gerrit\n2022\n3274\n100.0\n0.209\n0.182\n0.269\n0.390\n...\n0.007\n-0.001\n34.1\n39.8\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n4\n3262\n656302\nCease, Dylan\n2023\n3268\n99.8\n0.250\n0.155\n0.331\n0.405\n...\n0.024\n0.009\n31.0\n53.4\n10.736713\n-2.959811\n33.194060\n0.492823\n36.381789\n31.187335\n\n\n\n\n5 rows × 77 columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll want to pick your pitcher and filter the dataset to only include that pitcher.

For example:\n\nIs there a season where the strikeout count jumps up or falls sharply?\nIs your pitcher consistent or did they just have one breakout season?\nIs your pitcher trending up or down over time?\n\nAfter seeing the trends in your data, you can explore even further. Another statistic that is frequently used is K/9, which refers to the number of strikeouts per 9 innings. This can be more accurate to a pitchers actual ability as it can account for time spent injured or not playing as a starter. By modifying the code above, it can be a simple change to create a new column with values obtained by dividing the strikeouts by the innings pitched, then multiplying by 9.\n\n\n\nNow that you’ve seen me go through this process for Clayton Kershaw, you can take this code and make your own plot using any pitcher and any statistic. This code can be copied and pasted directly into a python script and run to create your own custom stat-over-time plot.\nWhen you’re finished, you should have a working python script, a simple, clean line plot using real MLB data, and a starting point for deeper sports analytics projects. The basic flow taught here, load in data -&gt; filter -&gt; group by desired stat -&gt; plot data, can be used as a starting point for almost any dataset to visualize data. Good luck!",
