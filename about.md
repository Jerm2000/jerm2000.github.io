## Background

Hello! I am a senior at Brigham Young University in Utah, but am originally from Montana. I enjoy living in a state where the outdoors is always just a few minutes away, whether its skiing, hiking, or fishing, I love it all. I have a wide range of interests in the field of data science, mainly related to personal experiences and hobbies. I am Hispanic as well as a first-generation American and student. This combined with pre-medical coursework in high school contributes to my interest in immigrant healthcare statistics. I also grew up watching baseball as a family activity, so sports analytics is something that I am passionate about.

## Education

- **Statistics** (data science emphasis)- Brigham Young University, Expected Graduation Date: April, 2026
- **Information Systems** - Minor
- **Relevant Coursework**: Statistics, Data Analysis, Python and Javascript programming

## Experience

- **Orem Rehab and Skilled Nursing** - I spent three years working at a skilled nursing facility, directly working with patients and assisting in activities of daily life. Part of my duties entailed communicating with Spanish speaking patients and recording information relevant to their conditions. I feel that this unique connection to and understanding of the healthcare field, specifically regarding the immigrant population, allows me to more effectively analyze immigrant healthcare statistics.

## Skills & Interests

### Technical Skills

- **Programming**: Python, JavaScript, React
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks, Git/GitHub

### Areas of Interest

- Immigrant healthcare analytics
- MLB (baseball) statistics

## Goals

In the short term, I hope to become more proficient with the data analysis process as a whole, going from choosing a dataset, cleaning it, visualizing it, and drawing conclusions. This is something that will come with practice and that I hope to highlight through my posts on this site. In the long term, I hope to be working in one of my areas of interest, either working for the government performing data analysis and inference based on immigrant healthcare data to better serve that population, or working with the MLB to identify variables of interest based on current season data.

## Get to Know Me

I love to work with kids, in the past I have worked as a substitute teacher and volunteered my time at local elementary schools. I also love to travel, although I do not frequently have the opportunity to due to the costs associated with being a student. I have been able to combine these passions in a meaningful way by volunteering in Mexico, the Dominican Republic, and Taiwan
